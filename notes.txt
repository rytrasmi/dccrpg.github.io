Open with a bang. Scene with action, bonding PCs from the get go. A menacing but easy fight like the bridge in "The Well".
A week ago, the PCs were in a travel caravan that was set upon by raiders. The raiders turned the captives over to a bunch of weirdos. They are now in a caged wagon on the way to somewhere.
A band of cataphracts (co-led by high ranking woman) from a nearby city (you can see smoke on the horizon) attacks the weirdos and frees some of the captives, but not all. The PCs must ask to be freed.
The woman reluctantly fees the PCs. She will toss them a wineskin of water if asked.
The cataphracts slay the weirdo leaders and take the special captives with them (they are nobles of the city).
The weirdo underlings and other captives, some freed some not, are left to their own devices. A fight breaks out.
The PCs can:
1. recover their gear
2. look dead weirdos and other gear
3. free other captives the cataphracts did not free
4. participate in the fight
Eventually they will head to the city as it's the only feature around.
