Open with a bang! Scene with action, bonding PCs from the get go. A menacing but easy fight like the bridge in "The Well".
A week ago, the PCs were in a travel caravan that was set upon by raiders. The raiders turned the captives over to a bunch of weirdos. They are now in a caged wagon on the way to somewhere. The wagons are pulled by arged and sickly animals.
It is hot and the PCs are weak, hungry, and thirsty. An old man is with them int the wagon. One of the weirdos tosses them some scraps to eat. Two of the PCs get some. The other PCs and the old man get none. Do they share and with who?
At dawn, a band of cataphracts (the woman is second in command) from a nearby city (you can see smoke on the horizon) attacks the weirdos and frees some of the captives, but not all. The PCs must ask to be freed.
The woman reluctantly fees the PCs. She will toss them a gourd of water if asked or if the PCs do/say something of note.
The cataphracts slay the weirdo leaders and take the special captives with them (they are nobles of the city).
The weirdo underlings and other captives, some freed some not, are left to their own devices. Some of the weridos flee. A fight breaks out.
The PCs can:
1. recover their gear
2. loot dead weirdos and search for other gear
3. free other captives the cataphracts did not free
4. participate in the fight or pick a fight
It will start to get very hot. The PCs will head to the smoke, as that is the only sign of life and that's where the cataphracts went and where some of the othre freed captives are headed.

Key NPCs:
The woman cataphract
The old man
