During <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2020/02/11/DCC-toronto-tuesday.html">house rules</a>DCC Toronto Tuesday</a>, we will be using a few slight modifications to the DCC RPG core rules. These are mostly to limit crunchy aspects of the game and hopefully makes things more smooth and fun.
<h1>Zero-Level Player Parties</h1>
<p>All of a player's peasants will be assumed to be at the same location. So, marching order will be player-based.</p>
<p>Of course, if you want one of your peasants to go off and do something, you can. But unless you say otherwise, they will stick together.</p>
<p>Initiative will also be player-based. You will roll once for all your peasants, applying the best modifier of the group.</p>
<p>In combat, a player's peasants will be assumed to be engaged with the same enemy or group of enemies. I will divide large groups of enemies into small groups of 2-4 individuals.</p>
<p>Monsters will attack a player's group of peasants and the player can decide who in the group takes a hit.</p>
<p>If you don't declare which peasant is doing something and it's important to know, I will ask you. So, if you say "I do such and such," I will only ask which peasant you are talking about if its important.</p>
<p>For example, if your group trips a trap, I will ask which peasant tripped it.</p>
<h1>Luck</h1>
<h2>Generally</h2>
<p>Luck will be awarded for critical successes (natural 20), feats of derring-do, cool role play, completing quests, and so on.</p>
<p>Awarded luck may be permanent or fleeting.</p>
<h2>Fleeting Luck</h2>
<p>Fleeting luck will be more or less like in Lankhmar but it will be player-based rather than character-based to keep things simple.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each player beings the game with 1 point of fleeting luck</li>
<li>There is no limit to the amount of fleeting luck you can have</li>
<li>A player's fleeting luck gets added to their characters' luck score when making luck checks</li>
<li>You can spend fleeting luck to aid any roll by any character, yours or another player's</li>
<li>Any time a character makes a critical failure occurs (natural 1), ALL players lose their fleeting luck</li>
</ul>
<h1>Save vs. Spellburn</h1>
<p>When using spellburn, a wizard must make a willpower save vs. the amount of spellburn or suffer corruption. For example, if a wizard burns 7 attribute points, then she must make a will save of 7 to avoid corruption. Save vs. spellburn is like any other save; the character's willpower bonus applies and luck can be burned.</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing the save by 5 or less, the wizard suffers minor corruption.</li>
<li>Missing the save by more than 5, the wizard suffers major corruption.</li>
<li>Critical failure (natural 1), the wizard suffers greater corruption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luck cannot be burned to avoid this corruption.</p>
