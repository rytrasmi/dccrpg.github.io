I will be running a game of Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) in downtown Toronto.

All are welcome.*

<b>When:</b> Alternate Tuesdays from 7:00 - 10:00 PM, starting March 10, 2020. I am committing to 10 sessions initially and we can keep on trucking from there.

Where: 401 Games in downtown Toronto at 750 Yonge St (theyâ€™ve moved). Just a 2 minute walk from Bloor-Yonge TTC station.

What to bring: Dice if you want. A snack perhaps. The store has snacks and drinks for sale. I will provide character sheets, dice, pencils, the rule book, everything we need to play.

Details:

The #1 objective is to have fun!

Players will start at level 0. We will then progress through several published modules tied together by a sandbox campaign setting. Progress will be swift, and I will aim to have each module completed in one or two sessions, give or take. You will likely level up every 2 or 3 sessions.

No commitment required. You may attend or skip sessions as your schedule demands. You will be welcomed back at any time with the same character(s) that you left off with. Nobody controls your character(s) but you.

If you've never played a tabletop RPG like D&D, then DCC is a great place to start. It's got simple rules and lots of flexibility to keep the fun times rolling!

If you have played D&D or its kin, then DCC is a bit different because:
<ul>
Classes, skills, feats, and all that are simplified. You can still do all of these things, just in different ways.

Magic is less predictable and can be more dangerous to the caster, innocent bystanders, and -- with luck -- the monsters.

Combat is faster and more lethal. 

Characters die more often! But don't worry, you'll probably go out in a heroic blaze of glory and have the bards sing your epic for ages to come. 

It's common (but not required) to run several characters and/or hirelings at once. You might have a main and a protege and perhaps a hireling or two. Some might stay in town, ready to take the reins if the active party takes an unexpected trip to Valhalla.

It can be faster paced. Things get weird quick, even for low-level characters.

* I take this very seriously and will do my utmost to make people from all walks of life feel welcome.
